The first step in troubleshooting your issue is to check your spam folder. Emails from Ledger Live might have been accidentally directed there. If you find the emails in your spam folder, you should add the sender's address, noreply@ledger.com, to your allowlist and then click on the verification link in the email. 

Next, you might need to wait for up to one hour. Email delivery can sometimes take longer than expected. If after waiting, you still have not received the email, go to the 'My Ledger' section, then 'Ledger Recover', and tap 'Didnâ€™t receive it? Resend'.

It's important to note that currently, Ledger Live does not support changing the email address associated with your account. If you've lost access to your original email address, you'll need to create a new Ledger Recover login with a different email address.

Another potential reason why you're not receiving an email could be that you are not a subscriber to Ledger Recover provided by Coincover. This is a paid service that offers a backup for your Secret Recovery Phrase. If you're not receiving a verification email, check to see if you've been paying for this service monthly. If you're not being billed by Ledger Trust Services, then you likely are not a subscriber to Ledger Recover provided by Coincover.

Finally, if you're attempting to log into Ledger Live with your email and experiencing difficulties, it's worth noting that newer versions of the Ledger Live app now feature a 'Log in to Ledger Recover' option during the initial setup phase. This option is specifically designed for Ledger Recover subscribers. If you're not a subscriber, please select the 'Get started' option instead, which will guide you through the standard setup process for Ledger Live.
